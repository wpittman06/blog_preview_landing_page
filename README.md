## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more about using flexbox with t his project. I am still learning it's utility and knowing how to work it is getting better.

### Continued development

Areas in which I wish to ceek continued development are debugging I had an issue with one of the images and it took me a while to figure out what happened and it ended up being a css specificity issue. Took me some time but if i learned a better process debugging I'm sure it would've gone by faster.
